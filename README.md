# provability_sat

WIP. Uses inversion (validity of consequence implies validity of premises) to find a sequent calculus proof for a given formula.

A proof will be found (given enough time and memory) if one exists. 

At the moment this works for propositional logic and, to a bug-affected degree, first order logic with not too many quantifiers.
